# Head-Pose-Estimation-using-OpenCV-and-Dlib

To estimate a head-pose based on 2D image, I modified a bit of code from "Learn OpenCV" site 
(https://www.learnopencv.com/head-pose-estimation-using-opencv-and-dlib/). 

I would like to add several functions to estimate a head-pose. 
The final result of this project is shown as below.

Please change file location and file name when you run this code.
and before running this code, you have to download trained files ('shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat') from this page (https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat). 

Please let me know if you have any comments and discussion.
